# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Entries are grouped under a release heading by change type (`Added` / `Changed` /
`Fixed` / `Removed`) and updated per feature or pull request — not per commit. The
per-commit "why" lives in each commit message body; richer rationale for a change
set belongs in its pull request description.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Scene status workflow: scenes now carry a `status` (`Draft`, `To Proofread`,
  `To Edit`, `Final`) backed by the `SceneStatus` enum, plus a freeform `notes`
  field. Status renders through a reusable `scene-status-badge` Blade component on
  the scene create/edit/index screens and the story overview.
- Story Overview page (`projects.story.index`) combining the full act → chapter →
  scene tree on one read-only page, with a collapsible table of contents and scene
  contents rendered as Markdown.
- Feature tests for the scene resource (`tests/Feature/SceneTest.php`) covering CRUD,
  authorization, validation, and position auto-assignment; model factories for
  `Act`, `Chapter`, and `Scene`.
- Project coding guidelines (`.claude/guidelines.md`) and a `documentation/` folder
  (architecture, code style, best practices, glossary).

### Changed

- Reordered scenes in the story overview via AJAX (no full page reload).
- Restyled the story overview typography and act headings.
- Consolidated the `MelusineSeeder` chapters into fewer, denser chapters.
