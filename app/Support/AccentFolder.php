/**
 * Folds accented Latin characters to their plain lowercase ASCII base so search
 * can match across accents: a search for `Melusine` finds `Mélusine`, and the
 * reverse. This is the single source of truth for accent folding used by every
 * part of search that must agree on what "matches" — {@see ProjectSearch}
 * (both the entity gate and the per-field label check) and {@see SearchSnippet}
 * (offset + highlight).
 *
 * Why a hand-rolled map instead of a DB collation, `Str::ascii()`, or an SQL
 * expression:
 *   - Matching is done in PHP, not SQL, so it is identical and portable across
 *     every driver. The default (and production) database is SQLite, whose
 *     `LIKE`/`lower()` fold ASCII case only, never accents, with no `unaccent`/ICU
 *     collation; and a folding SQL expression (a deep nested-REPLACE chain)
 *     overflows SQLite's parser on some builds. See documentation/architecture/README.md
 *     → Project search.
 *   - A fixed, explicit map keeps folding deterministic and identical everywhere
 *     it is applied (gate, label, snippet).
 *
 * > [!IMPORTANT]
 * > The map is deliberately **1 character → 1 character**. Folding therefore never
 * > changes a string's character offsets, which is what lets {@see SearchSnippet}
 * > locate a match in the *folded* text and then slice/highlight the *original*
 * > (accented) text at the same offsets. Expanding ligatures (ß→ss, æ→ae, œ→oe)
 * > would break that invariant and are intentionally **out of scope** — a search
 * > for `coeur` will not match `cœur`. Keep every entry a single base letter.
 *
 * @see SearchSnippet sibling stateless helper that relies on the offset invariant
